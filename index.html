             <p>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy 
                 with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss
                of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence,
                that I neglect my talents.</p>
